# Introduction

**EMAR** is an open-source, tele-operated Emergency Assistance Robot, designed to reduce the amount of exposure medical staff have with patients and potential patients during pandemics and similar situations we may face in the future. 

The idea for this open-source tele-operated robot came as I was sat in room in a hospital surrounded by people with COVID-19 as a potential COVID-19 Pneumonia patient. The doctors, nurses and other teams were in among us for the whole 12 hours or more I was in the hospital.

Some of the common things I saw was nurses & doctors calling patients, giving paracetamol, taking temperatures, adjusting masks and blankets. Every time one of the medical staff had to do one of these tasks they were putting themselves in danger of catching COVID-19.

Each of these tasks can be carried out by tele-operated robots, so this is where the idea came from.    

__This project is a work in progress, however our plan is to work with a local medical/health center or hospital to do a pilot project.__
